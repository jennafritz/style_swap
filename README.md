## Room for Improvement
To do:
- Introduce friend request feature by aliasing user model
- Add ability to request private swap of specific clothing from a friend's closet
- More advanced styling (carousel component for "Current Styles" preview section)
- Stricter categorization of clothing to enable filter/search functionality within swaps and within friends' closets (all or individual)
<!-- Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- Improvement to be done 1
- Improvement to be done 2 -->
